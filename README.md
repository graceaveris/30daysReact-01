**Day One / 30 days of React challenge / "Question and Answer" app**

For my first project i've created a super basic React app that shows a question, and then reveals the answer upon clicking.

**Concepts Explored:**
- How to pass props
- Intro to state

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
